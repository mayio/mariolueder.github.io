I am a software engineer working in the field of object tracking for autonomous driving in Hamburg, Germany. The goal is to estimate the pose and kinematics of dynamic objects and small obstacles in the surrounding environment of a car using point clouds comming from multiple a solid state Lidar scanners. Over the past years I am became experienced in the fields of Multiple Extended Target Tracking and Clustering, which are strongly related to a probablistic perspective of Machine Learning.

I am experimenting and doing a lot of research to improve the performance of that system. I am keen to learn and would like to share my knowledge here when I feel it is not sufficiently covered somewhere else. I hope this blog and my github repository is useful for someone else.
